    <h2>5/5/17: Am I Insane?</h2>
    <p><i>&quot;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&quot;</i> &mdash; Questionably Albert Einstein
    </p>
<p>I was part of a precollege classical music program during high school, and one mandatory class we had to take was jazz. I didn&#39;t know why this was, but I was excited, because jazz sounded cool. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed. Not by jazz itself, but by the fact that it didn&#39;t come easy to me. I like to think of myself as a resilient person, but sometimes when I reflect on my past, I am surprised by just how brittle I am.
</p>
<p>This happened a number of times in my violin career. I&#39;m a very ambitious person, and usually I succeed in being above&ndash;average at what I do. But when I don&#39;t, I get very discouraged. Like, my standard amount of effort didn&#39;t work, what&#39;s the point in trying anymore?
</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&#39;t compare myself to other people, but this is often a confounding factor. I don&#39;t resent people who do better than me&mdash;that is definite. I know what it feels like to be resented for succeeding. If I start to feel resentment, I push it away because I know I&#39;m just mad at myself. 
</p>
<p>But then I&#39;m back to the same issue&mdash;I feel disappointed in myself and I don&#39;t try harder. That&#39;s what I mean by being &quot;brittle&quot;. I just give up too easily. And it&#39;s funny because I already knew that about myself, I just didn&#39;t know how deep that habit was until this semester.
</p>
<p>So why did I think I was resilient? Well, if you go through a lot of rejection, you might think you&#39;re good at handling it. It&#39;s some sort of messed up self&ndash;flattery. But really, failing a bunch of times when you&#39;re doing the same thing over and over is just insanity.
</p>
<p>I guess that means failing twice only hurts if you didn&#39;t try harder the second time. To use the contrapositive, if you try harder every time, you won&#39;t be disappointed no matter the results (Can I pass my Concepts final now?).
</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes you fail and it&#39;s out of your control. Just thinking about that bothers me. The first time my dad told me &quot;just try your best in life&quot;, I said &quot;but what if I fail?&quot; But in practice, I find I can accept it. I applied to an REU at Cornell this summer and didn&#39;t make it in. The professor who wrote my rec letter had told me that first&ndash;years tend not to get REUs because they favor seniors. 
</p>
<p>At first I thought this meant that I needed to take more classes, but that confused me since a large part of research is learning new material anyway. I even expanded my application, describing how qualified I am at &#39;learning&#39;, which would make up for my lack of experience. But then I met with my prof again and she elaborated that it&#39;s because seniors simply need the opportunity more than I do. I realized that no matter what I said in my app, if this was the mindset, then if I didn&#39;t get the REU, it wasn&#39;t my fault. 
</p>
<p>This is an example of something else I learned about myself this year: I often make incorrect assumptions. Like, thinking that I can&#39;t handle failure, when I can. As long as I feel I tried, it doesn&#39;t bother me. It&#39;s like when people say, &quot;it&#39;s the journey that counts&quot;. I&#39;ve only ever believed that superficially. Like, sure, the experience of working hard is always helpful and enlightening, but how can the destination not matter? I&#39;ve never believed that, but now I think I see it. It&#39;s something you find to be true. Even if you don&#39;t reach your goals, you will feel satisfied if you worked hard. 
</p>
<p>I thought I wouldn&#39;t feel satisfied, or something like that. I guess that&#39;s what people mean by &quot;fear of failure&quot;.
</p>
<p>I feel a bit better knowing that somehow, I&#39;ll find peace even if I fail. I don&#39;t understand why that happens, but I&#39;m grateful to biology for making it so.
