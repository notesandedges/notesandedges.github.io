    <h2>April 21, 2017</h2>
<p>I guess engineers typically feel out of place in modern art exhibits. Such was the vibe I got when bringing two meche master&#39;s students from Hyperloop into the Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) Exhibit with my friend, an art major. For the most part we were able to identify which objects in the building were exhibition pieces and which were genuinely just part of the building. However, there was one controversial item.
</p>
<p>It spanned the entire length of one wall, and was composed of pale&ndash;red sheets of cloth hanging side by side. It almost looked like the wall was covered up for construction. A quick look at the program told us otherwise: &quot;Letting &ndash; blood on cotton bedsheets with pins&quot;. 
Upon further inquiry we found that the blood in question was the artist&#39;s and his boyfriend&#39;s. His other works included picture frames pressed with flowers and eyelashes. My friend, who had him as a TA, said he has a jar where he collects peoples&#39; belly button discharge.
</p>
<p>That was a bit too modern for me. But the sheets did remind me of Doris Salcedo&#39;s A Flor de Piel at the Guggenheim, where I went with my family once. It is a tribute to a female nurse who was raped and tortured to death during the Colombian civil war. Composed of hundreds of chemically preserved rose petals, the hand&ndash;stitched blanket was draped over the floor in a white room at the very top of the spiral&ndash;shaped Guggenheim. Similarly, Letting was draped over the walls at the top of our Miller art gallery. And there was the red color, which in Letting was from actual blood but in A Flor de Piel, recalled the torture the nurse went through. I think that blanket was one of few art pieces which made me really feel something.
</p>
<p>As one of the masters students remarked on our way out, &quot;these things stick with you, they change your mind in some way.&quot; 
</p>
<p>The four of us went on another adventure the weekend afterward. Our target exhibit was the fashion display at the Carnegie art museum by fashion designer Iris can Herpen, the materials scientist that never was.
</p>
<p>I never really considered how fashion and materials science overlap. In fact, I usually avoid fashion because I&#39;m somewhat uncomfortable in my own skin.
</p>
<p>But this fashion was beautiful, and its beauty came from the materials science. My favorite dress, entitled &quot;Wilderness Embodied, Dress, July 2013&quot;. It&#39;s description was &quot;Laser&ndash;cut Japanese changeant fabric and viscose.&quot; By eavesdropping on a nearby tour group, I learned that cutting fabric with blades (i.e. scissors) pulls on individual threads, disrupting the fabric structure and causing fraying at sharp edges. However, by laser cutting designs into the dress, van Herpen circumvented this drawback.
</p>
<p>Up close, the dress looks like its exquisite innards are spilling out of itself. Yet even from far away, the edges and triangles hanging out of the dress do not seem completely random. The light reflecting off of the &quot;changeant fabric and viscose&quot; contributes to a macroscopic pattern as well (the word macroscopic used loosely here). There is beauty up close and from afar, which I think is a testament to IVH&#39;s artistic eye.
</p>
<p>I liked how van Herpen&#39;s pieces were all so different. The dresses were categorized into themes, yet the themes themselves were worlds apart from each other. Another interesting technique I saw was a round dress made from some rubbery material with many different ridges. The pattern of ridges was created by embedding the material with iron filings and then moving a magnet around to elevate the filings. There was a touch&ndash;and&ndash;feel part of the exhibit where we could feel the various materials and see the embedded filings up close.
</p>
<p>van Herpen&#39;s works reminded me of how neuroscientist May&ndash;Britt Moser wore a neuron&ndash;embroidered dress to the 2014 Nobel Prize ceremony. I really appreciated it then, because science has so much beauty in it and when you incorporate something meaningful into something beautiful, then it has power.
</p>
<p>As usual, I departed from the van Herpen exhibit with a developing plan&ndash;of&ndash;action. I want to meet Iris van Herpen. More than that, I want to wear one of her dresses. Maybe if my life takes a turn for the better, I&#39;ll wear IVH to my own Nobel Prize ceremony!
</p>
<p>At the very least, I can take comfort in the fact that part of this dream is recognizable right now&mdash;the plastic models wearing IVH were fairly short.
