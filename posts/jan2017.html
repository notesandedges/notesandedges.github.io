    <h2>January 25, 2017</h2>
<p>It&#39;s only been 20 days and 2017 is already so different than 2016. </p>

<p>This semester seems to be off to a shaky start. It&#39;s definitely a step up from last semester, with more new material and more work. It&#39;s now that I&#39;m starting to realize maybe I&#39;ve overcommitted myself even though I tried to avoid it. But then I realized, that&#39;s just how I am. I like being busy, and I get bored with things easily. I&#39;m trying hard to adjust and change my habits so I can deal with all of it. A large part of that is making peace with the fact that all of this is new to me, so my usual strategies for planning, studying, working might not hold. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m excited about is the mathematics course I&#39;m taking. It doesn&#39;t focus on a certain field like Algebra or Calculus; it&#39;s more of an introduction to how to think mathematically and construct proofs. Right now, it&#39;s my favorite class for a number of reasons. First, the professor is pretty cool: </p>

<p>*Proves Pythagorean Theorem by drawing a square* <br>
Professor: So there&#39;s a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which I think if you don&#39;t like that you might have no soul. </p>

<p>Professor: You probably have already heard of this but an integer has &#39;even parity&#39; if it is divisible by 2. So 14 is even because it is 7*2. And, if you haven&#39;t made peace with this yet, 0 is an even number because 0=0*2. </p>

<p>Professor: That box means the proof is over. We used to write Q.E.D. which means something in Latin like &#39;that which was to be demonstrated&#39;. But then we decided that sounded too pretentious so now we just draw this box instead. </p>

<p>Second, this is the only class I have with an appreciable &#39;Collaboration Policy&#39;. As in, we are allowed to collaborate on homework assignments as long as we list the people we worked with when handing in our work. One aspect of college that I was looking forward to was collaboration, and so I&#39;m glad to finally be practicing it. </p>

<p>The best part of this class is the learning atmosphere that it highlights. This course has a notorious reputation at my school because it attracts students of all majors and mathematics professors of all temperaments. I was a bit terrified when I registered for it and still am waiting for the worst to happen. Part of the reason for this was because of a conversation I had with a friend who took this class last semester (with a different teacher). He told me that there are a lot of proofs and &quot;you kind of just have to have this intuition to be able to do them. If you don&#39;t, then there&#39;s not much you can do.&quot; </p>
<p>I despise when people say things like this about a topic I know well because in my experience, &quot;smartness&quot; isn&#39;t a tangible enough phenomenon to justify us not being good enough at something. But, my friend seemed pretty confident, and I had no idea about this course, so I kind of just accepted it. Another thing he said was that this course was a &quot;weed&ndash;out&quot; course, meant to make all of the students who didn&#39;t have the &quot;intuition&quot; to drop out so that in later courses they wouldn&#39;t struggle as much. I told my friend this was a stupid way to provide students with a proper education, and he was like &quot;Yeahâ€¦I don&#39;t know.&quot; </p>

<p>Fortunately, on our first day of class, my professor addressed these topics immediately. He told us that whoever may have said that the proofs in this course would &quot;come naturally to some people is completely wrong. My goal is that you will struggle in this course, and while struggle generally has a negative connotation, in this course it will help you. So don&#39;t misunderstand&mdash;this is not a weed&ndash;out course.&quot; </p>

<p>Many classmates whom I spoke with after our first lecture said our professor&#39;s words made them feel more confident, which is nice. </p>

<p>In other news, I think I&#39;m making headway as a member of the Hyperloop team, but in a roundabout way. For some reason, even though I joined the team back in September, the issue of me not being a masters student and thus lacking significant knowledge of mechanical engineering was never brought up. I realized this when talking to a new member the other day and he told me to review a bunch of concepts about the &quot;Strength of Materials&quot; and then learn Solidworks. At first I was a bit angry. I was constantly frustrated last semester that I couldn&#39;t seem to contribute  much to the team, so when the gaps in my education were directly addressed (and I was given an actual course of action), I felt annoyed that no one had brought it up sooner. </p>

<p>Now though, I realize I may have been getting ahead of myself. The structure of the SpaceX competition is such that much of the design phase for this year&#39;s round was completed last year, so there really wasn&#39;t much I could do. I joined when all of the finishing touches were being made, and so all I could really help with was manual labor. </p>

<p>Now that classes are getting harder and I&#39;ve had this realization about Hyperloop, I have to remember not to blame myself if things go wrong. Or, I have to remember to forgive myself. </p>
