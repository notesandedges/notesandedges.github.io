    <h2>August 2016..........................8/15/16</h2>
    <p>On the college front: I think I finished everything. Completed all the courses on computing and alcohol education, 
    filled out all the forms, registered for classes, sent in my picture for my photo ID, got all my dorm room equipment. 
    I&#39;ve also been looking into all the research, club, and enrichment opportunities my college offers. I don&#39;t feel 
    ready, but I feel prepared.</p>

    <p>Besides that, I&#39;ve been keeping myself pretty busy with other things. In addition to learning a lot of new things 
    this summer (how to d3.js, how to cook slightly better, how to play jazz violin), I also learned a lot about myself. </p>
    
    <p>When it comes to handling stress, I have some room for improvement. During senior year, I was expressing my 
    frustrations to a friend, and he told me &quot;you need a hobby, something you can work on that&#39;s not work.&quot; 
    I guess that&#39;s obvious, but I have a hard time balancing hobbies and work&mdash;when I have a lot of work, I skip 
    the hobby part and end up really burnt out. This summer I returned to some hobbies that I abandoned during high school 
    and discovered that there are a few I haven&#39;t yet grown out of. Hopefully I can prevent getting burnt out before 
    junior year again.</p>
    <p>One of the hobbies I picked back up was crocheting&mdash;which, just for the record, is far superior to knitting. 
    I wonder if joining the Yarnivores club at my college will allow me to partake in heated discussions surrounding the 
    schism. Anyway, the reason why I resumed crocheting was actually to finish off a loose end that had been gnawing at my 
    mind for about 8 years. </p>
    <p>When I was in 4th grade, my mom put me in the district&#39;s afterschool program because she had to work late. 
    There I was exposed to a wide range of pastimes typical of 9 year old girls in the early 2000s: Tamagotchis, Webkinz, 
    hula hoops, jewelry making, and most notably, circular knitting. The program had a bunch of arts and crafts materials, 
    including these small tubular spools that my friends and I used to create long ropes of knitted yarn. It&#39;s a pretty 
    boring activity, if not slightly addicting: you just keep unhooking the yarn from each pole on the spool and then wrap 
    some new yarn around for the next layer. We had a sort of unspoken contest, a contest really of patience, for who could 
    knit the longest rope.</p>
    <p>I&#39;m a pretty competitive person, so by the end of that phase I was the one with the longest rope, about 15 feet. 
    My mom was pretty annoyed, she said it would collect dust and what was I going to do with it anyway? It was too thin for 
    a scarf, too long for a belt, too weak for an actual rope. I experimented with coiling the rope up on itself several 
    times to create a cushiony rug, but it was too short so the rug was pretty small. I tried layering the coils to make a 
    container, but it wouldn&#39;t hold its shape. I tried a lot of things, but in the end I just left it there, a colorful 
    yarn worm to decorate the dark drawer of my room for years to come. Until this summer, that is, when I decided I would 
    finally make something amazing and useful out of the darn thing. Behold, the ridiculous cowl:</p>
    <div class="pics1">
        <p> 
            <img class ="pics1" src="https://notesandedges.github.io/posts/pics/august2016/1.jpg" style="width:250px;">
        </p> 
    </div>
    <p>(please excuse my hair)</p>
    <p>Did you ever get an idea to do something and think to yourself, this is a really awesome idea, but in the end, the 
    awesomeness didn&#39;t exactly come through? That&#39;s basically what happened with this cowl. It&#39;s ok though. 
    It&#39;s pretty warm, so when I come home for winter break I can use it while shoveling snow in the dead of the night 
    when no one will catch me wearing it. And I think I made up a new crochet stitch in the process, it sort of resembles a 
    braid. Finally, even though this cowl was slightly disappointing I used the idea to create another cowl for my mom for 
    her birthday:</p>
    <div class="pics1">
        <p> 
            <img class ="pics1" src="https://notesandedges.github.io/posts/pics/august2016/2.jpg" style="width:250px;">
        </p> 
    </div>
    <p>Which turned out a lot better, if also slightly ridiculous. I think I&#39;ll take a break from cowls.</p>
    <p>Much of my activities this summer involved tying up loose ends in my life. There was nothing else to do with my time 
    really, aside from prepare for a new and terrifying chapter in my life. My sister always used to say that I never finish 
    projects that I start&mdash;which is actually true. I leave books unread, start art projects and abandon them, start 
    initiatives and leave them toâ€¦fester. I get really upset when she tells me that, it makes me feel phony. The last time 
    she did I stayed up until 2am making a thousand paper cranes to prove her wrong. She was like, &quot;well, this was just 
    one time.&quot; </p>
    <p>This summer I resolved to complete as much unfinished business from my &#39;childhood&#39; that I could. Besides the 
    ridiculous cowl, I fixed some broken earrings for my mom that she left under my care a few years ago. I started 
    practicing jazz improv, fingered octaves, and tenths on violin, as well as an insanely hard piece I learned about two 
    years ago in theory class. I collected a bunch of old notebooks that I only wrote in for a few pages and kept writing in 
    them: my ideas, thoughts, schedules, etc. I&#39;m big on making schedules. I love them very much. I revisited my old 
    reading lists and personal projects&mdash;this blog was one of them. I exercised a lot too, made a couple routines, and 
    plan to investigate all of the options I&#39;ll have in Pittsburgh. I refuse to acquire the Freshman 15. But that&#39;s 
    for another post. All in all, I followed through with a lot of things and I&#39;m proud of that.</p>
    
    <p>During these exploits, I was surprised to find that I can now accomplish much more than I could when I was younger. 
    For example, my crochet cowls, no matter how ridiculous, actually looked like cowls this time around instead of lumpy 
    deformations of yarn. And never before did I have the patience (nor the hand dexterity or stamina) to practice through 
    thirds, sixths, octaves, fingered octaves, and tenths on my violin in a single day. I mean, that&#39;s just patience, 
    but wow. I&#39;m pretty damn good at it.</p>
    
    <p>But yeah. That was my summer. I will definitely miss it, not just everything I did but the feeling of &quot;why not 
    now?&quot; whenever an idea, no matter how whimsical, crossed my mind. I know I have a lot to look forward to and to 
    focus on, but I&#39;m a bit scared about finding the balance&mdash;finding enough time to process it all, hobbies or 
    not. I guess I thought keeping busy with lots of things this summer would simulate what it&#39;ll be like in college, 
    but now I realize it&#39;s more the opposite. Keeping busy with what you want to do, on your own agenda, is much 
    different than keeping busy with schoolwork. Oh well. At least this summer was worth it, and I think (I hope? I pray?) 
    that I have enough energy left for what&#39;s coming.</p>
