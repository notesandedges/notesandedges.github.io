    <h2>November/December 2016...................12/8/16</h2>

    <p> I was feeling a little bit guilty for not writing a post for November, since I wanted to keep up with this 
        commitment to myself. Part of the reason why I didn&#39;t make a post was that I couldn&#39;t think 
        of what to write about. There wasn&#39;t any &quot;unifying theme&quot; for the month of November that 
        accurately described my life. I decided to keep waiting until it all became clearer, but the exact 
        opposite happened. In the past few weeks, I feel like I&#39;ve become so much more unsure of what 
        I&#39;m going to do.
    </p>

    <p>Then today, I realized that being confused is just as important as being in control of things, so here goes.
    </p>

    <p>Although I tried not to join too many extracurriculars this semester so I could focus on my grades, 
        the one club I did join is my school&#39;s Hyperloop team. We are competing in the SpaceX Hyperloop 
        Pod Competition. There are a number of other teams I could&#39;ve joined related to building fast 
        vehicles, particularly at this university. Honestly though, I&#39;ve never really been interested 
        in automobiles; Hyperloop stood out to me because of its novelty. It will literally revolutionize 
        transportation. 
    </p>

    <p> I was kind of frustrated with the club though, because there seemed to be a general lag in team 
        communication. I spoke to a masters student on the team who is graduating in December, and he acknowledged 
        some of the issues, but pointed out that part of the problem was that I wasn&#39;t making enough of an 
        effort to keep up with team occurrences. I couldn&#39;t wait for the team captains to &quot;hold my hand&quot; 
        and tell me what to do, since they&#39;re graduating this December anyway. I was surprised by this because I 
        never thought that I, of all people, would have issues with taking initiative. I guess it&#39;s just been so 
        long since I&#39;ve been at the very bottom of the totem pole. Or maybe initiative in college really <i>is</i> 
        different than initiative in high school. 
    </p>

    <p>After we reached the conclusion that I needed to take more initiative, we started talking about whether 
        he had found a job yet, and about careers in general.
    </p>

    <p>He asked me, &quot;why do you want to get a Ph.D?&quot; and I blanked out. I told him it might be because 
        my dad has one. But that wasn&#39;t the truth. It was honestly difficult for me to remember the truth, 
        because I made this decision such a long time ago. 
    </p>
    
    <p>I think it had something to do with this. When I was in sixth grade, my grandma died, and since this was 
        the first serious death I&#39;d experienced in our family, it got me thinking a lot about life and death, 
        and of course, the purpose of life. I became a little bit depressed thinking about how we&#39;re all just 
        going to die in the end. Eventually I asked my dad what the purpose of life is.
    </p>
    
    <p>This was a particularly ripe time to discuss the meaning of life because the movie Avatar had just come out, 
        and my little brother was going through a Star Wars phase so my dad couldn&#39;t resist tagging along. He 
        spent a ton of time lecturing us about the theology of Hinduism, the meaning of &quot;avatar&quot; and how 
        the force in Star Wars is a representation of the Hindu &quot;Om&quot; which connects all things. Part of his 
        lectures described how our souls live forever to learn as much as they can and then they join God when they 
        reach the state of knowing everything about our world and the universe. &quot;Therefore,&quot; he said, 
        &quot;the purpose of life is to learn as much as you can.&quot;
    </p>
    
    <p>That sounded good to me. I mean, I liked school, so why not? I asked, &quot;so what do I do if I want to learn 
        as much as I can in life?&quot; He said, &quot;get a Ph.D.&quot; 
    </p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m glad I remembered this. It was bothering me that I couldn&#39;t even remember why I wanted a Ph.D. 
        The masters student had asked me this question because I had asked him, why don&#39;t you get a Ph.D., 
        and he said he wouldn&#39;t be able to sit in a lab all day. And, after all the damn polishing I&#39;ve 
        done this semester as an MSE major, I agreed. But, did this mean I didn&#39;t want to get a Ph.D.? 
    </p>
    
    <p>Then I asked him if he thought engineering is more difficult than research, and he said yes, which confused 
        me more because my materials science professor said that she didn&#39;t feel she was being challenged when 
        she worked as an engineer before obtaining her Ph.D. He said that in research, only 10% of what you work on 
        becomes applied in every day life. He wants to work on something that&#39;s always impactful.
    </p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m not sure I agree with his reasoning, but I definitely don&#39;t want to be polishing for the rest of my life.
    </p>
    
    <p>Another thing he said was that I should figure out what I want to do now, like if I want to get a Ph.D or what, 
        because it&#39;s early and I have time. But my matsci professor specifically told me &quot;you don&#39;t 
        need to decide all of this right now.&quot;
    </p>
    
    <p>However, what bothered me most about our conversation was that I left it feeling like a horrible person. 
        I knew I shouldn&#39;t have, but I found myself telling this masters student about all the grudges I&#39;d 
        built up in high school. I consider bitterness my &quot;Achilles heel&quot;, so to speak. I keep grudges 
        for a loooong time and I have a hard time letting things go. I told him about my vendettas against past 
        Science Olympiad team members, against college decisions and the unfairness of it all. 
    </p>
    
    <p>While I described this to him, I found myself thinking, why am I <i>still</i> so bitter? It&#39;s…immature. But 
        it&#39;s what kept me going this semester, I think? I wanted to make up for it, I wanted a second chance. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Where I come from, there was so much pressure to be seen as &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;hard&ndash;working&quot; 
        and &quot;successful&quot;, and if you could hit all those targets well enough, you (usually) got the label 
        for it too: Ivy League. When I didn&#39;t get that label, I felt more than just sad that my own goals weren&#39;t 
        achieved. I felt like I let my community down. 
    </p>
    
    <p>But looking back, it was backwards to view myself through my community&#39;s standards. In some ways, I 
        accomplished so much more for my community by not fitting into its mold. But at the beginning of this 
        semester, getting good grades, tirelessly researching internships for freshman, joining Hyperloop—it was 
        all because I felt I had a second chance to prove myself.
    </p>
    
    <p>Now, I see things more clearly. I and my community aren&#39;t tied together anymore, and I realize that what 
        I do doesn&#39;t always need to be colored by the standards placed on me in one corner of the 
        oft&ndash;disregarded sliver of land known as Central Jersey. Fun fact: in the late 1900s my town was a 
        center of eugenics research (and, the case can be made, human rights abuse). There must be something in the 
        soil from those sad days that leaked through generations to the present day inhabitants.
    </p>
    
    <p>So, I&#39;m glad I came here. I guess, 
        when you come from a 20th&ndash;century eugenics ghost town, the Ivy League lure doesn&#39;t leave you that 
        quickly. Now and then, that bitterness resurfaces. That&#39;s probably why I found myself rehashing to my 
        Hyperloop teammate the unflattering part of my flawed personality. At least he found it ridiculous enough to 
        laugh at. And because of that, I think I can start to let it all go.
    </p>
    
    <p>I think every day, I come closer to seeing the reality of it all. The big picture, where I fit in. Where I 
        can spend three hours talking to a grad student from India about his lifelong interest in automobiles, and 
        if he&#39;ll ever return to playing jazz drums in a &quot;fusion&quot; band back in India. Me, a jazz violin 
        wannabe who gets motion sickness in most vehicles.  And yet there we were, at the Starbucks a few blocks from 
        our university, where we&#39;re both working to make the world&#39;s 5th mode of transportation a reality. 
    </p>
    
    <p>And although I still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do, I do acknowledge that, even if I get a Ph.D, 
        that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll achieve infinite wisdom, because there&#39;s so much more to life than 
        whatever I could gain from four intense years of intense rock polishing.
    </p>
    
    <p>Before I end, I&#39;d just like to say that though I complain (often unjustly) about the rigors of the 
        #matsci life, there&#39;s definitely something to be learned about resilience:
