    <h2>6/23/17</h2>
    <p><i>&quot;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&quot;</i> &mdash; Questionably Albert Einstein
    </p>
<p>In middle school, I was part of a clique of girls who all went to Chinese school together. At that age, they often spoke Chinese to each other for fun. 
</p>
<p>It made me feel left out. And 7 years later, I still can&#39;t stand it when people speak a different language right in front of me. 
</p>
<p>The circumstances have changed though. Rather than jest, people just find it easier to speak their native tongue. They want to stay within their comfort zone, and it&#39;s my job to draw them out of their cages.
</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t call myself a shy person, but that&#39;s at my best. When I&#39;m not feeling confident, I become shy. And, when I don&#39;t understand what is going on around me, I become less confident. It used to be a matter of knowledge: I wouldn&#39;t speak because I didn&#39;t think I was qualified enough. Now that I am more comfortable with not knowing things, it&#39;s more a matter of personality. Do the people around me like me, and want to know me? Do they care how I look or that all I do is stare at my notebook? Do I annoy them, but they&#39;re too nice to say something?
</p>
<p>Worrying about my personality ties back to self&ndash;esteem. Something I didn&#39;t realize until recently is that self&ndash;esteem is different from self&ndash;improvement. As long as I can remember, I&#39;ve focused on self&ndash;improvement in a very systematic way. I make schedules for my goals and how to achieve them. I usually fall short, maybe because I never cultivate the self&ndash;esteem to keep me going long enough.
</p>
<p>My most vivid experience which called attention to my self&ndash;esteem was during a warm&ndash;up activity for the Improv Comedy StuCo I took last semester. &quot;Beast Bird Fish&quot; involves a person going around the circle of participants and saying very quickly, &quot;Beast bird fish ____, one two three four five six seven eight nine ten!&quot;, where &quot;____&quot; is &quot;beast&quot;, &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;fish&quot;. The target then has to name a &quot;beast&quot;, &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;fish&quot; before the person stops counting, and no repeats are allowed.
</p>
<p>We were playing a more fun version of the game, &quot;Beast bird fish infinity mode&quot;, where &quot;____&quot; can be anything. It was the middle of the game when the person in the middle stopped at the person next to me and said, &quot;Beast bird fish thing you like about me!&quot; My neighbor said the first thing which came to mind, &quot;your shirt.&quot; Then he stopped at me and asked &quot;Beast bird fish thing you like about yourself!&quot;
</p>
<p>I swear I felt a collective intake of breath from everyone in the room. We all knew the answer which we tell ourselves every day, &quot;nothing&quot;. But I couldn&#39;t say that. This was a rare case of me not blanking out under pressure, and I said &quot;my hair&quot;.
Everyone said &quot;aw&quot;, maybe out of relief. The girl next to me said &quot;I like your hair too!&quot; It was nice, but an eye&ndash;opener about how I view myself. 
</p>
<p>Improv Comedy challenged this view constantly. During a scene, I couldn&#39;t spend time worrying about how I looked or came across, because then I wouldn&#39;t be focused on coming up with new material. I just had to put myself out there, like I need to while I am in Japan.
</p>
<p>Improv Comedy relates to studying abroad in other ways. For example, the &quot;yes, and&quot; rule must always be applied. In Improv Comedy you must never negate your partner. If you do, whichever fantastical universe you were in suddenly ceases to exist as the audience is brought back to reality. 
</p>
<p>Japan is like that in more ways than one. When studying abroad, especially in Japan, saying &quot;no&quot; is calamitous, or at the very least will cause you to miss out on golden opportunities.
Also, the politeness which permeates most conversations at the konbini, in the lab, etc. leaves me wary to break the scene with my Americanness. It also leaves me wondering what people really think. 
</p>
<p>Regardless, I&#39;ve worked hard at saying yes to everything. I&#39;m somewhat proud of the many things I&#39;ve done as a result: play futsal, watch an electone concert, and attend a maid café.
</p>
<p>The closest I&#39;ve come to seeing Improv Comedy is in the maid café I went to in Osu Kannon. The standard definition of a maid café is &quot;café where the serves are cute girls who dress as maids and treat customers as their masters.&quot; This sounded perverted when I first heard about it, but actually going to one completely changed my perspective. I don&#39;t think the maids improvise, since it is a cosplay restaurant. But I think it&#39;d be cool to have a restaurant in the U.S. where customers pick a character and the waiters do improvise that character.
</p>
<p>Despite the growth I experienced during Improv Comedy, I still face obstacles trying to communicate with people. However, if I can get past the language barrier in Japan, I can get past any barrier back at home.
