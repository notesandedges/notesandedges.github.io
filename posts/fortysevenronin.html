    <h2>6/6/17: The 47 ronin and ZDT</h2>

<p>When I was in elementary school my mom sent me to an afterschool program until she finished work. One of my favorite things to do was read a book called &quot;Stories from Around the World&quot; by Heather Amery. It was an older edition than the one you&#39;ll find on Amazon today, with a red cover, palm trees, and one of those elephants draped with jewels and colorful fabric. Each page had a different design according to whichever country the current story originated from. It&#39;s really hard to remember the stories now; I remember one was about a snake charmer.
</p>
<p>One day I&#39;m going to read that book again, to see why it fascinated me so much the first time. I&#39;ll probably end up being disappointed since younger me was fascinated by many more things than present me.
</p>
<p>I&#39;d also read it again to see if there are any differences in values among cultures represented in the book. I enjoy learning about folktales and legends from different parts of the world. This past year I tried to read one night of the Penguin Classics Arabian Nights before I went to sleep. That didn&#39;t work out though because some of the tales became so incredibly bizarre or erotic that I had to stop for a while.
</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;m actually living in another country, I can experience ancient tales on a deeper level. During my last day in Tokyo, I finally went somewhere by myself: Sengaku&ndash;ji, a Buddhist temple which also houses the graves of the Forty&ndash;seven ronin.
</p>
<p>I first heard about the 47 ronin during our visit to the Edo&ndash;Tokyo Museum. Our tour guide showed us a model of Edo Castle, home of the Tokugawa shogunate, &quot;the last feudal Japanese military government, which existed between 1600 and 1868&quot; (Wikipedia). In it, she pointed out Matsu no Oroka, the Great Pine Corridor, and explained the story of the Forty&ndash;seven ronin. 
</p>
<p>When I searched up the story later, several things interested me. First, the ronin&#39;s path to revenge reminded me of the movie Zero Dark Thirty, especially the final attacks on Kira&#39;s and bin Laden&#39;s estates. Both sieges happened at night, and involved taking out henchmen before accessing to the target, who ended up hiding with the women and children. I found it interesting that the same plot which unfolded when tracking down an infamous terrorist in modern times also occurred 300 years ago among samurai in Japan.
</p>
<p>Another parallel I observed the similar fates of the 47 ronin and the protagonist of ZDT, Maya. The 47 ronin (or 46, since the messenger was spared) were sentenced to commit seppuku. Maya too faced her own form of seppuku in that, after bin Laden&#39;s death, she had nothing left in her life.(draw parallels btw criticism and big picture)
</p>
<p>I wonder if what Maya faced in the end could be considered &#39;honorable&#39; in the same way as the 47 ronin&#39;s seppuku. Namely, both Maya and the ronin had avenged the cause they&#39;d worked toward for much of their lives&mdash;either the victims of 9/11 or the honor of their master, Asano Naganori. Yet they also sacrificed themselves, either figuratively or literally.
</p>
<p>I&#39;m having trouble imagining why seppuku is considered the most honorable way for a samurai to die though. Today, I don&#39;t think many people would say that suicide is admirable. The kind of people who would are ironically the victims of the modern day &quot;47 ronin revenge&quot; which I just described. 
</p>
<p>When I first heard of seppuku, I thought that the reasoning was that a samurai is in control of his own destiny, so he chooses to take his own life rather than leave it in the hands of someone else. Some sources describe it as suicide to avoid enemy capture, which is true. However, it&#39;s not a cop out either. It&#39;s more that being captured by the enemy is considered dishonorable for a warrior. Here is an Encyclopedia Britannica excerpt:
&quot;Being an extremely painful and slow means of suicide, it was favoured under Bushidō (warrior code) as an effective way to demonstrate the courage, self&ndash;control, and strong resolve of the samurai and to prove sincerity of purpose. &quot;
</p>
<p>What struck me most about my visit to Sengakuji was that it&#39;s still there after 300 years. Fresh incense lines each grave, and the cemetery lies in the middle of Tokyo. Not only does this suggest the core values of honor and loyalty in Japanese society, it helps us realize how these values fit into modern day society in new ways.
