    <h2>Making <i>Shrikhand</i>...................8/13/16</h2>
    <!-- add picture -->
    <p>One thing my parents like to do together is make Indian sweets. It&#39;s kind of like team bonding, but for our 
    family. Likeâ€¦family bonding. Yeah, that&#39;s it.</p>

    <p>After some years of observation, I&#39;ve decided that making Indian sweets is an activity to be contained within
    the privacy of your own home. This way, you&#39;re sheltered from opinionated relatives who each have something to say
    about the process behind making the traditional cuisine.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My parents themselves are very opinionated as well:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us: *return from relatives&#39; house*</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom: I&#39;d be embarrassed to serve mohanthal like that to guests.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us: *watching a YouTube tutorial on making shrikhand*</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad: He used saffron coloring. Somebody shoot him.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p> viewed as a rather boring topic.</p>

    <p>t&#39;s good in moderation.</p>

    <p>mes he can mention his alma mater without seeming borderline conceited).</p>

    <p> topic.</p>

    <p> from other carbon structures. </p>

    <p> a way that attracts and retains younger generations.</p>

    <p>teps.</p>

    <p>re education in MS may shape my thoughts 20 years from now.</p>

    <p>nteresting to think about.</p>

    <p>All in all, this book is good to reread if I ever forget why I like science.</p>
