    <h2>Rakuzan Kakuozan.............July 30</h2>
    
<p>(Continued from &#39;RoboCup 2017&#39; post) The next day was also very fun. We had told Tom about RoboCup, so he went in the morning (he absolutely loved it) and then we all met to go to the Rakuzan Kakuozan Summer Festival near Nittai&ndash;ji temple at 2pm. There I met Unon, a former Nakatani&ndash;RIES fellow. She was super friendly and gave me a hug when we met, which was good since I felt a bit nervous about meeting her. She had told us to wear our yukata, but I didn&#39;t know to put mine on by myself so I didn&#39;t. However, when I asked her, she said that with practice, she learned how to put on her own yukata. I know I only have a week left in Japan, but this is a new goal of mine. Even if I have to go to Japanese festivals in the U.S., I will learn how to put on my own yukata. </p>
<p>We walked around the festival a bit, which wasn&#39;t traditionally Japanese. Instead, it was a mix of many cultures, notably Brazilian. I enjoyed watching the opening performance, in which men and women were singing and playing on the drums. They were all smiling and swaying and it looked like they were having a really good time. </p>
<p>After Tom and Unon&#39;s friend Shiori arrived, we went to a caf√© called Ichirin, which had a really nice garden (with many mosquitos) and interesting sweets. I got Goma (black sesame) pudding and Will found Rose Calpis. Then, we visited Nittai&ndash;ji. </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even process this when Unon explained it to me, but Nittai&ndash;ji is one of the 8 places in the world where THE Buddha&#39;s ashes are stored. As in, Gautama Buddha, the original guy who went into the forest and got enlightened. A few years ago I watched a documentary with my mom about uncovering the bones of the Buddha in India, and there was this quote about happiness which I never forgot by a happy monk: </p>
<p>It&#39;s really amazing that I just visited a temple where the ashes are actually stored. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no daibutsu, just a small one, but it was nice. </p>
<p>We walked around more. There were many kawaii children, handicrafts, and cultural foods. I tried shaved ice at the request of Nakanishi&ndash;sensei. </p>
<p>After that, Tom and I decided to go to a Tanabata festival in Ozone. I don&#39;t know why it was happening this weekend since Tanabata is usually at the beginning of July. All I know is that there were so many festivals and happenings in Nagoya this weekend and it was lit. </p>
<p>We arrived just as the festival was starting. Or maybe, the festival started when we arrived. Anyway, as we walked, I noticed these sculptures featuring the same little girl up and down the street. In the first one, she seemed to be learning something from a princess, so I thought it depicted what all little girls aspire to be. The second sculpture showed the same little girl, this time standing in front of an old man. Ok, I thought, maybe she&#39;s applying what she learned and helping this old man. However, Tom and I got really confused when we arrived at the third statue, in which the girl was riding on the back of a winged monkey. The label behind the sculpture, &quot;The Winged Monkeys&quot; wasn&#39;t too informative. It wasn&#39;t until we got to &quot;The Cowardly Lion&quot; and Tom was like, &quot;That lion looks like me&quot; that we had an epiphany. The statues along this street were showing the story of the Wizard of Oz. </p>
<p> &quot;Why?&quot; I asked. </p>
<p> &quot;Cuz we&#39;re in OZ&ndash;one!&quot; replied Tom. Tom&ndash;san is a very smart cookie. </p>
<p> (10/14/17) I don&#39;t recall the rest of the festival too well, only that there were bananas covered in chocolate and sprinkles which I wish Will was there to have. I walked around more with Tom, and we found a turtle in a giant pot of plants. Behind us, some people were playing with balloons and one popped and Tom shouted in surprise, which was really amusing. We also saw some long&ndash;horned beetles which were being sold in plastic boxes. Tom said his mom used to have some of her own, which is really neat. </p>
<p>After that we met Will at the Aratama&ndash;bashi Aeon, then went back home. We talked about research vs engineering, a long&ndash;contemplated question of mine. Tom said it was fundamentally a difference of whether you work on something you have a curiosity about, or whether you work on something useful. I hope I can find something where they overlap. </p>
<p>I really enjoyed spending time with Tom. He&#39;s a very driven and inspirational friend, and I hope our paths cross again. </p>
