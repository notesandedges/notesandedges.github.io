    <h2>September 2016...................9/18/16</h2>
    <p>When I was younger, September was my favorite month of the year. The smell of graphite from freshly sharpened pencils, 
    the dull sheen of smooth erasers, the promising white pages of new notebooks, the feel of new jeans (perhaps my 
    inclination toward materials science was clear from a young age). Then there was the excitement of seeing old friends, 
    starting new classes, and finally this renewal of energy I received coming home each day to the gentle breeze swaying 
    the evergreens, oaks and maples that rose up from my backyard against the blue sky, under the tame sun, from dark green 
    to bright to just turning. I felt like Heidi, living in the mountains, without any worries or cares.
    </p>

    <p> As I grew older my anticipation for September remained but became increasingly colored by various stresses: 
    maintaining good grades, getting involved in extracurriculars, dealing with overcommitment, applying to college.
    </p>

    <p>And now here I am, at college, that the looming mountain which before seemed so far away. In some ways it&#39;s still 
    looming&mdash;I still have to climb it, and I&#39;m not looking forward to what&#39;s on the other side. But walking back 
    from class last week, alongside the green Cut and past the giant pole, a breeze swept past me and I thought &quot;this is 
    when the trees start swaying at home and the sky is blue and the sun isn&#39;t too loud or too mute, but just right&quot;. I didn&#39;t actually think that, but I got that impression of walking up my driveway and seeing the image play out before me. I guess I was homesick for a moment there.
    </p>

    <p>This September I didn&#39;t bother with newly sharpened pencils&mdash;I&#39;m trying to see how long my purple 
    mechanical pencil lasts before I lose or break it. Same with my erasers and pens, salvaged from forgotten pencil 
    cases and desk drawers back at home. I&#39;m only two weeks into school and my notebooks are already a quarter of 
    the way filled. I haven&#39;t worn jeans since two winters ago. It drizzles unpredictably in Pittsburgh and the sun 
    hides behind fickle clouds.
    </p>

    <p>Life isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s just an adjustment. My dorm room is small so I&#39;ve had to exercise some packaging 
    engineering skills to get everything to fit comfortably. The meal plan blocks are really large so I&#39;ve had to 
    exercise more to avoid getting the Freshman 15 by the end of this month. I&#39;ve been drinking tea a lot because 
    everyone got sick during Orientation and now that epidemic is merging with an outburst of colds due to the changing 
    weather. Finally, I&#39;ve started eating tomatoes because whenever I order something &quot;with no tomatoes&quot; 
    they give me tomatoes anyway. 
    </p>
    
    <p>When I spoke to older kids about how college compares to their prior lives, they all said the most striking feature 
    was your newfound independence. I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot, since independence is a pretty broad term that
    covers a many different areas of our lives.
    </p>
    
    <p>I&#39;ve always been a more independent person, not just introverted but self&ndash;made. I find ways to amuse 
    myself on my own, and I push myself for the sake of self&ndash;betterment. In this regard, I fit well into this new 
    independence that is college life. I can exercise when I want without worrying about when I have to be down for dinner. 
    I can perfect my study habits without the cloud of extraneous assignments and class group work we practiced in high 
    school (which is why in some ways the lecture method is good). I can go crazy making schedules and actually follow 
    them without relying on other people&#39;s schedules and routines.
    </p>
    
    <p>Then there&#39;s my social life. In high school, I felt as if my independence was a personal flaw. If I wasn&#39;t 
    part of a gaggle of girls I felt awkward stares and out of place. In college, no one cares who you&#39;re with and 
    no one judges you if you&#39;re alone. People respect introversion and acknowledge that you never know the story 
    of the person sitting next to you so there&#39;s no point in judging them anyway.
    </p>
    
    <p>That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t have friends. Friendship in college is a slower kind than I&#39;ve encountered 
    before. You don&#39;t see the people you&#39;d like to hang out with all the time, which makes your time with them 
    more special, your conversations more meaningful and sustaining. I really despised the awkward, incoherent and 
    pointless banter that so many of my peers called &#39;friendship&#39; in high school, which is why I didn&#39;t 
    partake in any of it and was perceived as aloof. Maybe that&#39;s a bit harsh, and probably my opinion is biased 
    due to my genuine social awkwardness, naivety, and boring range of interests. But it&#39;s a smoother process now, 
    it makes more sense. I feel like I understand relationships better now than before.
    </p>
    
    <p>In contrast with this more settled journey of friendship is the fast&ndash;paced and ever&ndash;changing adventure
    of navigating a college campus community. There&#39;s always something going on: places to eat you haven&#39;t been
    to yet, improv and comedy shows, concerts, parties, clubs you need to join, people you have to talk to, etc. You
    try not to miss anything, but you have to make sacrifices. I thought I&#39;d learned my lesson about overcommitment
    last year but here I am again with a full plate. Not to mention that coursework is definitely heavier&mdash;I have
    more homework in college than I did in high school. 
    </p>
    
    <p>I guess it&#39;s good practice for me since I have trouble saying no to things in general. I like doing everything, 
    but I also like being the best at what I do, so its frustrating to have to settle and accept the balance. I&#39;m 
    learning.
