    <h2>October 2016...................10/21/16</h2>
    <p>October is the Monday of months. Its the beginning of a long trek ahead; the same can probably be said about February, 
    after the excitement of the new year dies down and you realize that the time has come for hard work instead of daydreaming 
    about the future. The only redeeming quality of this rain and wind worn segment of time is that on the very last day, 
    Halloween ushers in the holiday season (I&#39;m an optimist, so the holiday season for me starts at Halloween).
    </p>

    <p>In October, you have to transition from short term adjustment to college to long term adjustment. That means 
    settling into a fixed routine and deciding which streaks to keep and which ones to give up, vs signing up for all 
    the e-blasts and attending a million different club meetings. It means settling for movie night in your room instead 
    of exploring the city at night because freedom in college is overrated and overhyped. 
    </p>

    <p>It can be a struggle. How much do you really care about something? Sometimes, the amount you care doesn't manifest 
    itself in the effort you put in. It's easy to imagine your long-term goals coming true, but down in trenches of 
    everyday life, you're forced to see your goals from afar. And maybe they're not as glamorous then. 
    </p>

    <p>October is the month where classes start to get harder, and the lack of a break can make things monotonous and 
    put you at risk of burning out. On the other hand, October provides you with an opportunity to invest yourself 
    deeper into whatever you're learning.
    </p>

    <p>October is the month to practice focus. </p>
