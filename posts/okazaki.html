    <h2>6/21/17...............Meeting with Prof. Tsuneko Okazaki</h2>
    
<p>The first question I asked was &quot;where do you think biology is headed?&quot; or &quot;which direction would you like to see biology take in the future?&quot; This seem to strike both Prof Okazaki and her former student (Machida&ndash;sensei) as strange. &quot;We&#39;re both retired,&quot; they answered. I guess this meant they don&#39;t follow biology research as closely as they used to.
</p>
<p>However, they told me about Prof Okazaki&#39;s research after Okazaki fragments were discovered. It spanned a couple topics such as chromatin, centromeres, and artificial chromosomes. Prof Okazaki studied the structure of chromatins, and the proteins, other than histones, which cause DNA to coil up. She also uncovered the structure of the centromere. Machida&ndash;sensei said that even if you inject cells with DNA, they won&#39;t be transferred to daughter cells unless two structures are present: the telomeres and the centromere. Prof. Okazaki focused on the centromere during her later research.
</p>
<p>She was trying to create an artificial chromosome. Unlike virus vectors and other methods of genetic engineering, this wouldn&#39;t be harmful to human cells. Later, I asked Prof Okazaki what her opinion was of genetic engineering. She said &quot;we must be careful&quot;, but that her artificial chromosome research related to that.
</p>
<p>On the topic of Okazaki fragments, Prof Okazaki said that many in the scientific community didn&#39;t accept their findings at first, since people thought the fragments were broken&ndash;down products rather than essential components of the replication process.
</p>
<p>We were discussing this also from the lens of being a researcher. I shared my desire to work on something which directly impacts our lives. She agreed, and said that many people ask her what the development of her research was. Her answer is &quot;nothing&quot;. It was just to understand something, rather than to apply it. I told her that her discovery made many biologists very happy.
</p>
<p>I asked her what she likes about research. She said that she enjoys uncovering her own questions step by step. She acknowledged that it requires a lot of patience.
</p>
<p>She said it is important for young researchers to work for good professors. We discussed how to identify a good professor. They gave an example of Osamu Shimomura, discoverer of the GFP and a Nagoya Daigaku Nobel laureate. Shimomura&ndash;sensei had a great interest in anything fluorescent. Also both professors spent many years studying their topics. She noted that Prof Kornberg was one of the only researchers in his field at that time, which made him a good professor to work with.
</p>
<p>We also discussed her late husband. I asked what he was like and she said &quot;Research! Just research.&quot; She said he would wake up at midnight and go to the lab. Then I asked why she married him, and she didn&#39;t seem to know how to describe it. She looked at Machida&ndash;sensei and made a gesture, saying &quot;I justâ€¦caught!&quot; I took that to mean that the opportunity for marriage presented itself and she took it. I asked if she missed him. She said when he passed away she missed him very much, but now she has become accustomed to living alone.
</p>
<p>I asked her what struggles she faced as a woman researcher. She said that she was the only female faculty member at Nagoya, and that during meetings she was embarrassed to speak. I asked if she wishes she had spoken more, but she said no.
</p>
<p>I asked her about her struggles as a mother. She said it was difficult. I asked if she ever considered not working, or not being a researcher. She said she couldn&#39;t. In order to support herself and her kids, she needed the income.
</p>
<p>She said that her parents were disappointed with her because she was not a boy, and she didn&#39;t become a doctor.
</p>
<p>When Shinohara&ndash;sensei&#39;s secretary came and explained her relation to Prof Okazaki, her siblings came up. She has one elder sister and two younger brothers. The youngest died very early from an accident (mountain climbing). She remarked that her older sister was a strong leader, but that she herself was a follower.
</p>
<p>Prof Okazaki has outlived all of her siblings. I asked her what she is most proud of and she said &quot;because of my healthy body, I have been able to live long and stand all hard work&quot;. 
</p>
<p>I asked her what she enjoys doing in her free time. She said gardening, and said that the blackberries are now blooming so she will artificially pollinate them. She lives on the 8th floor of her apartment building so there are no insects to pollinate the plants.
</p>
<p>I asked what she likes to eat, and she said anything. She said it is so because she lives by herself.
</p>
<p>I asked about what kind of music she listens to. She said Tchaikovsky, his violin concerto, and Mozart, his symphony. She also enjoys Shostakovich. We had a conversation about violin. I told her that I play and she said that Reiji&#39;s father played violin. He left the violin with her and Reiji when he passed away, so she wanted her daughter to play. However, her daughter could not play well.
</p>
<p>I asked what she likes to read. She said that these days her eyesight is poor so she listens to CDs where the book is read aloud. She asked me if I knew any Japanese literature and I didn&#39;t, but she likes Snow Country and Musashi Miyamoto, a famous samurai. She said people are always surprised to learn that she enjoys Musashi Miyamoto, a great swordsman. 
</p>
<p>A good decision on my part during the conversation was to ask &quot;Do you have any questions for me?&quot; 
</p>
<p>We got on the topic of what I&#39;ve done in Japan. I told them about my time in Tokyo, and learned that they&#39;d never heard of Azabu Juban. She recommended I visit Kanazawa, in the Ishikawa Prefecture, since it has traditional Japanese architecture and beautiful garden. They told me that two cities, Kyoto and Kanazawa, were the only two which weren&#39;t bombed during WWII, and so the traditional setting remains preserved.
</p>
<p>I asked her what her favorite childhood memory is. She said that because she grew up during the war, her memories are of bombings and losing her home, so she has no happy memories.
</p>
<p>I asked her what she thought of America. She said America is very nice. She recalled driving from St. Louis to Stanford via Route 66, a long drive. She said her favorite place which she&#39;s visited is Sweden. She enjoyed Stockholm where she worked for 3 years for the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).
</p>
<p>She asked me about my research at Shinohara&ndash;sensei&#39;s lab. I told her about MoTe2 encapsulation in CNTs, and that I&#39;d like to explore encapsulation of biological molecules. She asked what purpose encapsulating DNA has, but I didn&#39;t know. She also asked if it is possible to make nanosheets of CNTs, which I didn&#39;t know either.
</p>
<p>Her daughter has grandchildren. She lives in Yagoto Nisseki, just like me. I asked if she enjoyed watching sumo with Reiji, and she said &quot;sometimes&quot;.
