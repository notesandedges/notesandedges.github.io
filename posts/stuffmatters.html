    <h2>Colloquium mentum: reflections on <i>Stuff Matters</i>...................7/17/16</h2>
    <p><i>&quot;Miodownik is a professor of materials and society at University College London. Along with that marvelous title,
        he has a Ph.D. in jet engine alloys, one of the more pleasingly niche Ph.D.s I&#39;ve heard of. But that might all have been
        immaterial &mdash; sorry &mdash; if he couldn&#39;t also write&quot;</i> &mdash;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/stuff-matters-by-mark-miodownik.html?_r=1">NY Times</a></p>

    <p><i>&quot;My favorite writer, the historian Vaclav Smil, also wrote a wonderful book on materials, but it&#39;s completely different
        from Miodownik&#39;s. Smil is a facts&mdash;and&mdash;numbers guy; he doesn&#39;t bring any romance to his topic. Miodownik is the polar opposite.
        He&#39;s heavy on romance and very light on numbers.&quot;</i> &mdash;<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Stuff-Matters">Bill Gates</a></p>

    <p>I finished my first book of the summer! As someone who has a notorious habit of abandoning books midway through, I feel marginally proud of myself.
        <i>Stuff Matters</i> was sent to me by the materials science engineering department at my college. The professor who wrote the accompanying letter said it
        was supposed to get me more interested in MS. I&#39;ll admit, I scoffed a bit when I received the book because I thought I would know everything in it,
        having explored MS a great deal in high school. I decided to read it though because it was a nice gesture, the cover looked cool, and in case
        there&#39;s something I missed during my high school pursuits I didn&#39;t want to appear ignorant in the fall. </p>

    <p>From the first chapter I realized the depth and breadth of my ignorance. The author, Mark Miodownik, starts by recounting the time he was stabbed
        with a razor and then segues into a discussion about the evolution, scientific processes, and aesthetic wonder of metals. It was very fascinating,
        firstly because I learned about the history behind common terms, such as &#39;steel&#39;, that I didn&#39;t know of before, and secondly because of the
        excitement that Miodownik displays when describing what I originally viewed as a rather boring topic.</p>

    <p>The remaining chapters each detail another material: paper, cement, chocolate, aerogels, plastic, glass, carbon, ceramic, and biomaterials.
        Miodownik&#39;s style is characterized by an unflagging excitement for anything science, a talent for communicating his feelings in a relatable way
        (in reaction to a familiar building being torn down: &quot;Either way I felt less sure of myself, a little less significant&quot;), singularly
        hand&ndash;drawn&mdash;yet still functional&mdash;diagrams, personal connections that add deeper meaning to the book (the razor incident), dry yet
        vivid (or is it just British?) humor (&quot;What if this giant glass phallus became a target for terrorists?&quot;), interesting analogies (&quot;Like a
        hugely polite guest, [the chromium] reacts with the oxygen before the host iron atoms can do so, creating chromium oxide&quot;), and deep parallels
        between our use of a particular material and its visceral meaning to the human race (&quot;Stainless steel makes us feel indomitable&quot;). Oh and many
        descriptions of his surprising knack for encountering life&ndash;threatening situations (&quot;then I hit a tractor&quot;). Sometimes he&#39;s a bit
        cheesy (&quot;You carbon be serious&quot;), but, like chocolate, it&#39;s good in moderation.</p>

    <p>I do wish he gave sources when referencing scientific discoveries though, especially in the chocolate chapter. Although not including citations
        made the discussions flow smoothly, and a quick Google search produced satisfactory enrichment, I prefer he&#39;d included them for the sake of
        ethos (there is a limit on how many times he can mention his alma mater without seeming borderline conceited).</p>

    <p>His chapter on paper was a bit disappointing&mdash;it was noticeably lacking in passion. As someone invested in origami,
        I feel he could&#39;ve gone into more detail about the types of paper and how they are made. Mostly he described how important paper
        is to us and how much we use it, but his signature penchant for beautifying the science wasn&#39;t as prominent and signified a lesser excitement
        for the topic.</p>

    <p>I would also have liked to have read better transitions between chapters. Although he includes a &quot;synthesis&quot; chapter that uses size to
        connect all of the materials together, with his forte in intermixing science and human nature, I feel like he could&#39;ve taken time to construct
        deeper connections among the different materials as well. For example, he could expand on the internal structure of carbon aerogels and how they
        differ from other carbon structures. </p>

    <p>Despite all of the nit&ndash;picky details I mentioned above, while reading this book, I was able to appreciate the colossal amount of passion,
        patience, and talent required to produce such a work. One theme I&#39;ve been exploring recently is the importance of communicating science accurately
        but interestingly to the public. During a summer internship sponsored by the Liberty Science Center, we were schooled in how to present our research in
        under 2 minutes. I realized that it&#39;s pretty difficult explaining to laymen why a certain field of research is important without stretching the truth.
        It is necessary to find the right balance though, otherwise scientists would get no funding and the world would regress into oblivion. Later in
        high school, I spent a lot of effort in making students aware of STEM opportunities available to high schoolers, and became much more familiar with the
        importance of communicating science in a way that attracts and retains younger generations.</p>

    <p>That said, I don&#39;t usually enjoy writing that seeks to show the general public why science is beautiful because either it simplifies concepts to
        the point of inaccuracy, or includes so many technical details that the reader becomes confused and lost. It&#39;s hard to find a balance, but this
        book did it for me. Science itself needs to be directed for the next century by leaders with the same emotional intelligence Miodownik uses to engage his readers.
        Those who can share their passion so effectively demonstrate their initiative in carrying the STEM fields forward, and inspire others to follow in their
        footsteps.</p>

    <p>I also realized that many of my thoughts about materials science, when crystallized (that is how you make a pun, Dr. M), might resemble the underlying
        themes of this work. For example, my first introduction to MS was in Science Olympiad when I investigated the regimented, periodic crystal structures of
        different minerals. Later, I appreciated the long&ndash;range symmetry and ordered complexity of amino acids in proteins for the same reason. In both
        phenomena, living and nonliving, I was amazed at how functional beauty arose from organization of materials on a nanoscale. This is essentially what
        Miodownik explains in his Synthesis chapter at the end of the book as he relates all of the materials together from the nanoscale to the human scale.
        I found this interesting because it gave me a glimpse at how a future education in MS may shape my thoughts 20 years from now.</p>

    <p>This method of connecting all of the materials also surprised me. I&#39;ve always viewed MS as an integrative field because of its interdisciplinary
        nature: it combines so many diverse fields of science, from biology to physics to geology. Now, I see that it is integrative for another reason: the vast
        scales of size that it transgresses. These two modes of thinking about MS are intrinsically related but still distinct in their own right; it&#39;s
        interesting to think about.</p>

    <p>All in all, this book is good to reread if I ever forget why I like science.</p>
