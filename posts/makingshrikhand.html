    <br>
    <br>
    <p>One thing my parents like to do together is make Indian sweets. It&#39;s kind of like team bonding, but for our 
    family. Likeâ€¦family bonding. Yeah, that&#39;s it.</p>

    <p>After some years of observation, I&#39;ve decided that making Indian sweets is an activity to be contained within
    the privacy of your own home. This way, you&#39;re sheltered from opinionated relatives who each have something to say
    about the process behind making the traditional cuisine.</p>
    
    <p>My parents themselves are very opinionated as well:</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us: *return from relatives&#39; house*
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom: I&#39;d be embarrassed to serve mohanthal like that to guests.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us: *watching a YouTube tutorial on making shrikhand*
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad: He used saffron coloring. Somebody shoot him.</p>
    <br>

    <p>It&#39;s sometimes amusing to witness them bickering like an old married couple:</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us: *four shrikhand videos later*
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad: She didn&#39;t put in enough elaichi &#40;cardamom&#41;
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom: Yes she did. You don&#39;t understand that you only put in a little bit for flavor. 	You&#39;re the kind of 
    person who sees a little bag of elaichi, that was the harvest of an entire field back in India, and says &quot;Dump 
    it!&quot; You need to chill.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad: Fine. I&#39;ll make the shrikhand myself. I am chill.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they went away and took naps in separate rooms.</p>
    <br>

    <p>It&#39;s also amusing how they handle the opinions of their elders. My dad is convinced the perfect Indian sweets can 
    only be replicated from the recipes of his butter&ndash;obsessed Gujarati mother. Meanwhile, my mom told me while my 
    grandma was visiting to wait until this week to make shrikhand, when the house would be &quot;cleared of people.&quot;</p>

    <p>It&#39;s not that we&#39;re very &#39;Indian&#39; either. We don&#39;t got to the temple every week or wear Indian 
    clothes more than once a year. If anything, making Indian sweets is our family&#39;s way of bonding through our 
    ancestral roots. It also tastes good.</p>

    <p>So without further ado, and with much hope that this post doesn&#39;t fall into a relative&#39;s Internet browser, 
    here&#39;s our recipe for shrikhand:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ingredients:</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2lbs/32 oz plain Greek yogurt<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 cups powdered/ confectioner&#39;s sugar<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/4 teaspoon crushed saffron<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 tablespoon milk<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 crushed cardamoms<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 chopped unsalted pistachios</p>
    <br>
    <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeeze all the moisture out of the yogurt: take a muslin cloth, or any light cloth that&#39;s not a towel, 
    scoop all of the yogurt into its center, and hang it or put weight onto it with a bowl underneath so that all of the 
    water leaks out. This will take a couple hours and some extra weight, such as math textbooks.</p>

    <img src="http://notesandedges.github.io/posts/pics/makingshrikhand/makingshrikhand/3.jpg" style="width:250px;">
    <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the color: Warm the milk and mix with the saffron and let sit in a separate bowl</p>
    <img src="http://notesandedges.github.io/posts/pics/makingshrikhand/makingshrikhand/4.jpg" style="width:250px;">
    <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assemble the shrikhand: When the yogurt is squeezed completely &#40;you should have about 3 cups&#41;, 
    whisk with sugar &#40;can be sifted&#41; one cup at a time, cardamom, and saffron/ milk mixture. To completely empty 
    the saffron/milk mixture from its bowl, scoop a bit of the yogurt back out and move it around the bowl to soak up the 
    color.</p>

    <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep whisking until the lumps are gone and the shrikhand is smooth, then sprinkle the pistachios on top.</p>
