    <h2>July 2016...................7/17/16</h2>
    <p>I don&#39;t want to go to college. Whenever I realize how close it&#39;s getting, all I can think isâ€¦<a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/words.html"><i>fac</i></a>.</p>

    <p>Which is probably why I&#39;m spending so much of my time doing things, making things, learning things. It&#39;s my distraction from all of the
        changes happening around me: our weekend shopping trips to pick up bedside lamps, laundry baskets, new clothes, the invitations and reminders
        I get in the mail from my college every other week, my parents&#39; constant lectures about staying fit and focused, as if they&#39;re cramming
        all of their wisdom into these last months before I leave.</p>

    <p>Every time I&#39;m with my little brother or visit my younger cousins, I find myself thinking about what people they&#39;re going to grow up to be:
        jocks? wannabes? leaders? followers? What will they do in high school, where will they go to college?</p>

    <p>Every time I visit my aunts and uncles, I find myself in the midst of animated discussions about politics and the declining field of health
        care, too ignorant to participate, only watchful of the storm brewing: what problems will our generation inherit? I am bombarded with the obvious
        &quot;are you ready?&quot; as if there&#39;s nothing else to say about such a momentous shift.</p>

    <p>Because it is momentous, not just in the sense that I&#39;ll be doing my own laundry, or even that I&#39;ll be away from my parents and friends and
        finding my way in a completely new environment. It&#39;s realizing that I&#39;m all I&#39;ll ever have, that adults too have limitations.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a time where your thoughts have no happy place. I try not to look back, nor to the future, but that&#39;s difficult because when you&#39;re like me, every moment
        of the present is spent thinking about how I could be spending it more efficiently. But what else is there to think about besides a limbo of shafts
        of sunlight, the smell of bread my dad makes every other Sunday as he transitions into old&ndash;people&ndash;hood, the thunder of the rain on the
        roof of our house, the inexplicable absence of rainbows?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s also a time to enjoy the summer as it&#39;s supposed to be. This week I made french toast with blueberry syrup and cottage cheese that
        tasted horrible (because I don&#39;t like french toast much anyway, but our pancake batter had expired), went rollerblading,
        <a href="http://6abc.com/news/2-women-struck-by-lightning-on-point-pleasant-beach/1429867/">narrowly escaped
        being struck by lightning</a> after a trip to the beach, where I buried myself in the sand and let the fine silica grains rub away at my dead skin,
        finished reading <i>Stuff Matters</i>, reread two YA series in just a few days, among other things to make the most of my childhood before it ends.</p>
