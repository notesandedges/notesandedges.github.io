    <h2>July 2016...................7/17/16</h2>
    <p><i>This post is part of a series of posts I'll be making each month to summarize my college experiences.</i></p>
    <p>Whenever I realize how close college is getting, all I can think isâ€¦<a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/words.html"><i>fac</i></a>.</p>

    <p>    Which is probably why I&#39;m spending so much of my time doing things, making things, learning things. It&#39;s my distraction from all of the changes
        happening around me: our weekend shopping trips to pick up bedside lamps, a laundry basket, new clothes, the invitations and congratulations I get in the mail
        from my college every other week, my parents&#39; constant lectures about staying fit and focused, as if they&#39;re cramming all of their wisdom into these last
        months before I leave.
    </p>

    <p>Every time I&#39;m with my little brother or visit my younger cousins, I find myself thinking about what people they&#39;re going to grow up to be: jocks?
        wannabes? leaders? followers? What will they do in high school, where will they go to college?
    </p>

    <p>    Every time I visit my aunts and uncles, I find myself in the midst of animated discussions about politics and the declining field of health care, too ignorant
        to participate, only watchful of the storm brewing: what problems will our generation inherit? I am bombarded with the obvious &quot;are you ready?&quot; as if
        there&#39;s nothing else to say about such a momentous shift.
    </p>

    <p>    Because it is momentous, not just in the sense that I&#39;ll be doing my own laundry, or even that I&#39;ll be away from home and finding my way in a completely
        new environment. It&#39;s realizing that, in the long run, I&#39;m all I&#39;ll ever have.
    </p>

    <p>    It&#39;s a time where your thoughts have no happy place. I try not to look back, nor to the future, but what else is there to think about besides a limbo of
        sunlight, the smell of bread my dad makes every other Sunday as he transitions into old&ndash;people&ndash;hood, the thunder of rain on our roof, the inexplicable
        absence of rainbows?
    </p>

    <p>    It&#39;s also a time to enjoy the summer as it&#39;s supposed to be. This week I made french toast with blueberry syrup and cottage cheese that tasted horrible
        (because I don&#39;t like french toast much anyway, but our pancake batter had expired), went rollerblading, <a href="    http://6abc.com/news/2-women-struck-by-lightning-on-point-pleasant-beach/1429867/
">narrowly escaped being struck by lightning</a> after a trip to the beach, where I buried myself in the sand and let the fine silica grains rub away at my dead skin,
        finished reading <i>Stuff Matters</i>, reread two YA series in just a few days, among other things to recall my childhood before it ends.
