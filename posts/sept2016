    <h2>September 2016...................9/18/16</h2>
    <p>When I was younger, September was my favorite month of the year. The smell of graphite from freshly sharpened pencils, 
    the dull sheen of smooth erasers, the promising white pages of new notebooks, the feel of new jeans (perhaps my 
    inclination toward materials science was clear from a young age). Then there was the excitement of seeing old friends, 
    starting new classes, and finally this renewal of energy I received coming home each day to the gentle breeze swaying 
    the evergreens, oaks and maples that rose up from my backyard against the blue sky, under the tame sun, from dark green 
    to bright to just turning. I felt like Heidi, living in the mountains, without any worries or cares.
    </p>

    <p> As I grew older my anticipation for September remained but became increasingly colored by various stresses: 
    maintaining good grades, getting involved in extracurriculars, dealing with overcommitment, applying to college.
    </p>

    <p>And now here I am, at college, that the looming mountain which before seemed so far away. In some ways it&#39;s still 
    looming&mdash;I still have to climb it, and I&#39;m not looking forward to what&#39;s on the other side. But walking back 
    from class last week, alongside the green Cut and past the giant pole, a breeze swept past me and I thought &quot;this is 
    when the trees start swaying at home and the sky is blue and the sun isn&#39;t too loud or too mute, but just right&quot;. I didn&#39;t actually think that, but I got that impression of walking up my driveway and seeing the image play out before me. I guess I was homesick for a moment there.
    </p>

    <p>This September I didn&#39;t bother with newly sharpened pencils&mdash;I&#39;m trying to see how long my purple 
    mechanical pencil lasts before I lose or break it. Same with my erasers and pens, salvaged from forgotten pencil 
    cases and desk drawers back at home. I&#39;m only two weeks into school and my notebooks are already a quarter of 
    the way filled. I haven&#39;t worn jeans since two winters ago. It drizzles unpredictably in Pittsburgh and the sun 
    hides behind fickle clouds.
    </p>

    <p>    Because it is momentous, not just in the sense that I&#39;ll be doing my own laundry, or even that I&#39;ll be away from home and finding my way in a completely
        new environment. It&#39;s realizing that, in the long run, I&#39;m all I&#39;ll ever have.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>    It&#39;s a time where your thoughts have no happy place. I try not to look back, nor to the future, but what else is there to think about besides a limbo of
        sunlight, the smell of bread my dad makes every other Sunday as he transitions into old&ndash;people&ndash;hood, the thunder of rain on our roof, the inexplicable
        absence of rainbows?
    </p>

    <p>    It&#39;s also a time to enjoy the summer as it&#39;s supposed to be. This week I made french toast with blueberry syrup and cottage cheese that tasted horrible
        (because I don&#39;t like french toast much anyway, but our pancake batter had expired), went rollerblading, <a href="    http://6abc.com/news/2-women-struck-by-lightning-on-point-pleasant-beach/1429867/
">narrowly escaped being struck by lightning</a> after a trip to the beach, where I buried myself in the sand and let the fine silica grains rub away at my dead skin,
        finished reading <i>Stuff Matters</i>, reread two YA series in just a few days, among other things to recall my childhood before it ends.
