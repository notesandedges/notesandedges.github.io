    <h2>Adventures of a Non-Music Major...................10/18/16</h2>
    <p>One day when I was jogging with my brother, a rising track star, he told me what keeps him going during long runs. 
        &quot;After a certain point I can&#39;t feel my legs anymore, so I just keep running indefinitely. I call them ‘legs 
        of steel’.&quot; He relished this last phrase with a satisfied smirk at its perceived coolness.
    </p>

    <p> I think college music students must have hearts of steel. Specifically, case-hardened steel. I don’t mean to say that 
        they are like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. Quite the opposite in fact&mdash;steel, a metal alloy, is soft and 
        ductile (as a heart should be). However, when carbon atoms are allowed to diffuse into steel during the 
        case&ndash;
       hardening process, they prevent defects in the steel from spreading. This results in a stiffer outer layer to protect 
        the softer inner core.
    </p>

    <p>As I said before, musicians’ hearts must be like this. While I’ve been learning about atomic defects of materials in 
        <i>Engineering the Materials of the Future</i>, elsewhere in Pittsburgh the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
        have been on strike for nearly a month in protest of projected salary cuts in upcoming years. While this act, coming 
        from the Steel City’s professional orchestra, could be considered enough to justify my above claim on the hearts of 
        musicians, it is not my main argument.
    </p>

    <p>Just a few days ago I walked into the studio class of one of the violin faculty members at my college. He was in the 
        process of berating one of his students for how she was playing. &quot;If you played this with an orchestra the 
        musicians would go on strike because of how you play!&quot; he said, then paused. &quot;Wait sorry—bad joke.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>I had asked this professor earlier if I could audition to study with him, even though he teaches music majors 
        &quot;exclusively.&quot; After I had played for about 30 seconds, he stopped me and told me that my previous 
        teacher knew nothing about playing the violin, that my fingerings were insane and my posture was all wrong. 
        He said he couldn’t teach me, but that I could attend his studio classes, where I would learn a lot just by 
        observing.
    </p>
    
    <p>Now, I wasn’t expecting to be told I was good at violin during this ‘audition’ (if you can call it that), but 
        I wasn’t expecting to be told I couldn’t play either. However, when I saw the harsh criticisms his students endure, 
        I realized I wasn’t unique. Watching more closely, I could tell that the professor cares deeply about his students 
        and pushes them because it’s a competitive business but he believes they can make it. &quot;I am deliberately making 
        you angry in the hope that you will retaliate with your best efforts,&quot; he told his student as she walked off 
        the stage. I resolved to continue learning what I could; if the trek is upward, so be it.
    </p>
    
    <p>During these studio classes, I’ve had the opportunity to witness the reality of what it means to major in 
        music&mdash;something I’ve always half-considered but never given real thought to.
    </p>
    
    <p>Watching the professor’s actual students play consecutive technical and emotionally demanding pieces with apparent 
        ease, I’m realizing that I’m not as close to Hilary Haun as I thought I was. I’m seeing the levels in between now. 
        Before, I used to watch Itzhak Perlman play and ask myself when I will be able to play as well as he does. Now, 
        I see these young music students, with all of their nuances of playing that surpass my skill but don’t quite reach 
        Perlman-level, and ask if I will ever be able to play as well as they do.
    </p>
    
    <p>I also realized that I kind of regret not being super good at one thing. Maybe if I wasn’t so focused on doing 
        everything, I would be as good as these musicians at violin, like my brother is at track.
    </p>
    
    <p>At the same time, I wonder how these musicians came to be students under this professor. At this master class, 
        only two students performed and they played the same exact pieces. Not in the same way, of course. But in a world 
        where making a living as a professional musician is already tough, what do these students have that will help them 
        create their own niche? What did this professor see in these students that told him they had something more to offer 
        the music community that hasn’t been seen yet?
    </p>
    
    <p>My final observation was a bit unnerving. During my ‘audition’, the professor exposed me to a way of viewing violin 
        that I’d never remotely considered before. One of the most interesting tidbits of our conversation was an almost 
        scientific proof that how one moves the bow is the most important means through which a violinist can control 
        their sound. I realized that, despite twelve years of playing violin, there’s a completely new world of thought 
        and study that I’ve missed out on. As I said though, I’m slowly finding my way there.
