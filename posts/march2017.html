    <h2>Pi Day, 2017: Streaks</h2>
<p>I think it&#39;s finally time to talk about streaks. Also known as not having unfinished business, tying up loose ends, focus, stamina, continuity.
</p>
<p>Ever since my sister accused me of not finishing anything I started, I&#39;ve been obsessed with proving her wrong. Truthfully, I think streaks define who you are as a person. They show coherence and, if they exist for self&ndash;improvement, maturity.
</p>
<p>I can start a new streak any time I want. The hard part is obviously sticking with it, and the hardest part is being flexible when things go wrong. For example, if I decide to feed Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich every Thursday, but one week I&#39;m out of peanut butter, I shouldn&#39;t decide to skip my dance class and go all the way to the store to buy more peanut butter. I should just give Pudge a tuna sandwich. He could use the protein anyway.
</p>
<p>And after that, I shouldn&#39;t worry that I am an abomination and then buy out the store&#39;s entire peanut butter supply to compensate.
</p>
<p>My point is, not being able to adjust when maintaining a streak results in binging, and not only does that end the streak, but it often has negative consequences. As in, the social worker shows up at my door the next day.
</p>
<p>I need to work on being flexible. Which is why one of my new streaks is going to be attending Yoga lessons every week from now until the end of the semester! I had this goal at the beginning of the year but it didn&#39;t really work out, and that was my fault. Ironically, there was this other guy who always wears a t&ndash;shirt with the peace sign and carries around a gallon of Arizona iced tea everywhere who told his friend &quot;I&#39;m just doing yoga because I want to be stretchy.&quot; I had no faith in him but now he&#39;s the only person in the class who can hold a crow pose for more than 5 seconds.
</p>
<p>I also want to maintain a streak of being efficient. Someone once asked me what my efficiency rating is. Efficiency rating? Like how productive you are each day. He thought his was 10&ndash;20%, and he thought most high schoolers have a limit of 25%.
</p>
<p>I don&#39;t even want to know what he&#39;d say now that we are college students. I just want to get to around 80%, and I know that currently I&#39;m not there yet. It&#39;ll take practice, and that&#39;s where streaks come in.
</p>
<p>But how to quantify efficiency ratings? The only way I can think of is one of my favorite hobbies: scheduling. I am sort of obsessed with creating schedules. Sometimes I create them ahead of time, and sometimes I create them as I go. When I was younger, I used to create elaborate (and colorful) Summer Schedules for my 3&ndash;month&ndash;long vacation, and then quit after a few hours. Fortunately, I&#39;ve acquired enough patience and maturity so that I can pull off daily and sometimes even weekly schedules pretty accurately.
</p>
<p>There are a couple tricks to scheduling that I&#39;ve learned. One is to be realistic, and that comes with collecting enough data to know how long something will take. The second is to schedule by task, not by time, when you can. If I know what exactly to accomplish and how long it&#39;ll take, that makes scheduling things much easier. Sometimes though, that isn&#39;t practical, especially when the task is &quot;study math&quot; or something like that. However, if I am at the end of my studying, I can usually pinpoint specific tasks to schedule for, like &quot;rewrite these definitions&quot; or &quot;review that specific problem&quot;.
</p>
<p>Another trick is to allow for productive downtime. During this time I write blog posts or schedules or check my email or play violin, for around half an hour. This helps me not burnout.
</p>
<p>Now that this post has turned into another &quot;my 2 cents on how to be efficient&quot; post by some random person on the Internet, I think I&#39;ll stop here and get back to my streaks. After all, Pudge controls the weather and, being a Pittsburgh resident, I must constantly appease him.
