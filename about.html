    <p><i>&quot;Creativity happens when you bring together disparate worlds. If you just do the one thing, and you meet people very similar to you, I think this
        often reinforces certain ways of thinking and deepens ruts. But where does creativity come from? It comes when you have different approaches
        intersecting.&quot;</i> &mdash;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/physicist-might-discovered-new-building-block-matter/">Suchitra Sebastian</a>
    </p>

    <p><i>&quot;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39t
        really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That&#39s because they were able to connect experiences they&#39ve
        had and synthesize new things.&quot;</i> &mdash;Steve Jobs
    </p>

    <p>Hey! I&#39m a college freshman from New Jersey. I grew up in a small, mid&ndash;to&ndash;upper&ndash;class town and currently attend a small,
        metaphorically mid&ndash;to&ndash;upper&ndash;class college in Pennsylvania, where I will hopefully graduate in a few years with a degree in materials
        science engineering.
    </p>
    <p>This all started when, a few years ago, I saw a graphic displaying data collected from a survey sent out to all U.S. colleges, asking each how they
        would rank themselves among others. The researchers had schools identify others that they thought they should be associated with. Each &#39node&#39 on
        the graphic represented a school, and each &#39;edge&#39; represented a claimed connection between two schools. Incidentally, this article seems to have disappeared
        from the Internet, and perhaps for a good reason. However, if you do a Google Image search on &quot;Gephi&quot;, you&#39ll see many pictures similar to
        what I saw.
    </p>

    <p>Now that big data is a thing, people are finding really neat ways of displaying it. However, this project isn&#39t really about data, or at least data
        in the form you typically except.
    </p>

    <p>This project contains data in the form of my ideas and thoughts on various topics, joined together according to shared words, phrases, themes, etc. The
        resulting network of my ideas could help me straighten out my thinking and see connections I didn&#39t notice before.
    </p>

    <p>And connections are really important. They inspire innovation and progress. For example, materials science is a young and fast&ndash;growing discipline
        because researchers are figuring out that combining physics with biology and chemistry and all sorts of STEM disciplines can help us find the answers
        to many of our problems in novel ways.
    </p>

    <p>So the main reason for this project is to give myself a chance to discover some connection or trend within my thoughts that I wouldn&#39t be able to
        discern if I just kept a journal or made a regular blog.
    </p>

    <p>The second reason is that I think a lot about many things, and I want somewhere to put all of it. But I need some sort of filter. As Sherlock
        Holmes says in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>,
    </p>

    <p><i>&quot;I consider that a man&#39s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes
        in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with
        a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into
        his brain&ndash;attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the
        most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when
        for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing
        out the useful ones.&quot;</i>
    </p>

    <p>When I first contemplated creating a web of my thoughts, I tried making a draft version. I soon realized that simply drawing bubbles around my hobbies
        and books I&#39ve read and connecting them is a pretty superficial way of thinking about how I think. I needed a more complicated, but not too cluttered,
        way of collecting and displaying the information. So, I decided that a blog, with decently written articles connected through some sort of word searching
        algorithm would be good enough.
    </p>

    <p>That&#39s the eventual plan. Right now, I&#39m exploring using Latent Semantic Analysis, which uses matrices to model documents and calculate the semantic 
    similarities between these documents using matrix mathematics. The <a href="http://lsa.colorado.edu/"LSA @ CU Boulder website> has been a great resource in learning about and applying this 
    kind of processing to my blog posts. In the future, I hope to explore different methods of connecting my thoughts, or refine this one.
    </p>

    <p>So this is what I&#39ve come up with after a few years of exploration. It might crash and burn, but that&#39s just more practice in failing for me.
