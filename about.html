    <p><i>&quot;Creativity happens when you bring together disparate worlds. If you just do the one thing, and you meet people very similar to you, I think this
        often reinforces certain ways of thinking and deepens ruts. But where does creativity come from? It comes when you have different approaches
        intersecting.&quot;</i> &mdash;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/physicist-might-discovered-new-building-block-matter/">Suchitra Sebastian</a>
    </p>

    <p><i>&quot;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39t
        really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That&#39s because they were able to connect experiences they&#39ve
        had and synthesize new things.&quot;</i> &mdash;Steve Jobs
    </p>

    <p>Hey! I&#39m a college student from New Jersey. I grew up in a small, town in Central NJ and currently attend Carnegie Mellon, where I will hopefully 
        graduate in a few years with a degree in materials science engineering.
    </p>

    <p>This project contains data in the form of my ideas and thoughts on various topics, joined together according to shared words, phrases, themes, etc. The
        resulting network of my ideas could help me straighten out my thinking and see connections I didn&#39t notice before.
    </p>

    <p>And connections are really important. They inspire innovation and progress. So the main reason for this project is to give myself a chance to discover some connection or trend within my thoughts that I wouldn&#39t be able to
        discern if I just kept a journal or made a regular blog.
    </p>

    <p>The second reason is that I think a lot about many things, and I want somewhere to put all of it. But I need some sort of filter. As Sherlock
        Holmes says in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>,
    </p>

    <p><i>&quot;I consider that a man&#39s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes
        in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with
        a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into
        his brain&ndash;attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the
        most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when
        for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing
        out the useful ones.&quot;</i>
    </p>
<p>My methods for this blog are as follows: I use I use <a href="http://lsa.colorado.edu/">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> to process each post, and then connect posts with an edge if their shared value is above the median of all the connections in the matrix. Nodes with more connections have a greater radius.
    </p>

    <p>So this is what I&#39ve come up with after a few years of exploration. It might crash and burn, but that&#39s just more practice in failing for me.
